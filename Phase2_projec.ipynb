    "## 1.1 Problem statement\n",
    "* The inadequate provision of clean water in Tanzania poses a significant challenge for the country's population of over 57 million. The existing waterpoints in Tanzania include wells that are in need of repair or have completely failed. To address this issue, there is a need to develop a classifier that can predict the condition of water wells based on various factors such as the type of pump used, installation date, and other relevant information._\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* The business problem at hand is to create a robust classifier that can accurately classify the condition of water wells in Tanzania into three categories: wells in need of repair, failed wells, and wells that are in good condition. This classifier can be valuable for decision-makers, government bodies, and non-profit organizations working towards providing clean and sustainable water solutions in Tanzania._\n",
    "\n",
    "* By accurately predicting the condition of water wells, stakeholders can prioritize repair and maintenance efforts, allocate resources effectively, and implement preventive measures to ensure a reliable supply of clean water to the population. Additionally, the classifier can assist in identifying patterns and factors that contribute to the deterioration of water wells, allowing for targeted interventions and long-term planning to improve the overall water infrastructure in Tanzania._"
